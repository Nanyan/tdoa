function locSource = MULocate(evVal)
% Takes in a 3x3 array that contains differing arrival times and the
%  locations of three WADN nodes in order to approximate the location of an
%  unknown radiation source (i.e. a malicious user).  
% The Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) Data Fusion method from Sayed, 2005
%  is used to find the location of the user.  Some of the terminology used 
%  is as follows:
%  - x1, x2, x3: the x coordinate of nodes 1, 2 or 3 (x1 is set to 0)
%  - y1, y2, y3: the y coordinate of nodes 1, 2 or 3 (y1 is set to 0)
%  - delT21, delT31: the time difference in signal arrival between nodes 2
%    and 1 and nodes 3 and 1
%  - c: the speed of light, in m/us
%  - r21, r31: the range differences from the unknown source between nodes
%    2 and 1 and 3 and 1
%================ Inputs =========================================
% evVal = A 3x3 array that has the values for the most recent single
%  event that three or more WADN nodes reported on.  These values are
%  needed to determine the non-WADN source (Malicious User) location.  Each
%  row is identical and each row has the format:
%  [Unknown Sig St Time, Node X-Location, Node Y-Location]
%================ Outputs ========================================
% xSource = x value of the radiation source
% ySource = y value of the radiation source

    % To reduce the number of unknown varibles in the least squares equation
